;Brief overview: Main infector unit enters a vehicle and turns it into a car bomb
;That unit now uses CARBOMB WeaponSet, which contains a unique weapon
;That weapon fires a projectile that creates a 'CarBombConversion' style crate
;Instantly turning the target into another car bomb, thus spreading the infection

;Tanks become units capable of infecting other units       (Crusaders, Warmasters, etc)
;Transports and anything else become suicide vehicles      (Humvees, Troop Crawlers, Gattling Tanks, etc)

;Pilots are murderized, and the module should look like this
